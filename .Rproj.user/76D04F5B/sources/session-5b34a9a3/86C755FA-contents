\title{Hypothesis Test for Population Proportion}
\usage{
hypothesis_test_proportion(n, x, p0, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size, the number of patients or cases.}

\item{x}{The number of patients or cases with the outcome of interest (e.g., adverse symptoms).}

\item{p0}{The hypothesized population proportion (e.g., 0.10 for 10%).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list containing the sampling distribution, test statistic, p-value, rejection region, decision, and conclusion, with all work shown.
}
\description{
Performs a hypothesis test to determine if the population proportion differs from a specified value.
}
\details{
This function checks assumptions, calculates the test statistic, p-value, and provides a one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis test on the population proportion.

\examples{
hypothesis_test_proportion(n = 440, x = 23, p0 = 0.10, alpha = 0.05)
