\arguments{
\item{mean1}{Mean of the first group (e.g., boys).}

\item{sd1}{Standard deviation of the first group.}

\item{n1}{Sample size of the first group.}

\item{mean2}{Mean of the second group (e.g., girls).}

\item{sd2}{Standard deviation of the second group.}

\item{n2}{Sample size of the second group.}

\item{alternative}{The alternative hypothesis. Use "two.sided", "less", or "greater".}

\item{confidence_level}{The confidence level as a decimal (e.g., 0.95 for 95 percent confidence).}

\item{equal_variance}{Logical, whether to assume equal variances (default is FALSE).}
