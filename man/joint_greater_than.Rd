\title{Joint Probability: Greater Than}
\usage{
joint_greater_than(dist1, dist2, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist1}{A named numeric vector representing the probability distribution of the first variable.}

\item{dist2}{A named numeric vector representing the probability distribution of the second variable.}

\item{k}{The threshold for the sum of the two random variables.}
}
\value{
The probability that the sum of the two variables is greater than \( k \).
}
\description{
Calculates the probability that the sum of two independent random variables is greater than \( k \).
