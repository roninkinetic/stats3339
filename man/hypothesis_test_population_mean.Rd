\title{Hypothesis Test for Population Mean}
\usage{
hypothesis_test_population_mean(
  sample_mean,
  sample_sd,
  n,
  population_mean,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_mean}{The sample mean (e.g., 31.6).}

\item{sample_sd}{The sample standard deviation (e.g., 2.3).}

\item{n}{The sample size (e.g., 12).}

\item{population_mean}{The hypothesized population mean (e.g., 33.5).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}

\item{alternative}{The alternative hypothesis: "two.sided" (mean != population_mean), "less" (mean < population_mean), or "greater" (mean > population_mean).}
}
\value{
A list containing the test statistic, p-value, rejection region, decision, and a detailed explanation of the work.
}
\description{
Performs a hypothesis test for a population mean using a sample mean, sample standard deviation, and sample size.
The function supports both one-tailed and two-tailed tests and provides detailed explanations of the steps.

\examples{
# Example usage for two-tailed test:
hypothesis_test_population_mean(
  sample_mean = 31.6,
  sample_sd = 2.3,
  n = 12,
  population_mean = 33.5,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided"
)

# Example usage for one-tailed test (less than):
hypothesis_test_population_mean(
  sample_mean = 31.6,
  sample_sd = 2.3,
  n = 12,
  population_mean = 33.5,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "less"
)
