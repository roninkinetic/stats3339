\title{Confidence Interval for Difference in Means}
\usage{
ci_diff_means(data1, data2, confidence_level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{A numeric vector of the first sample data.}

\item{data2}{A numeric vector of the second sample data.}

\item{confidence_level}{The confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for 95 percent confidence).}
}
\value{
A list with intermediate calculations and the confidence interval:
  \item{mean_difference}{The difference in sample means.}
  \item{pooled_standard_error}{The pooled standard error of the difference.}
  \item{t_value}{The critical t-value.}
  \item{margin_of_error}{The margin of error.}
  \item{lower_bound}{The lower bound of the confidence interval.}
  \item{upper_bound}{The upper bound of the confidence interval.}
}
\description{
Calculates the confidence interval for the difference in means of two independent samples.
Intermediate steps are included in the output.
