\title{Generic Hypothesis Test for Population Mean}
\usage{
hypothesis_test_mean(data, mu, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector containing the sample data.}

\item{mu}{The hypothesized population mean to test against.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list containing the test type, test statistic, p-value, confidence interval, decision, and conclusion, with all work shown.
}
\description{
Performs a hypothesis test to determine if the population mean differs from a specified value.
}
\details{
This function calculates the test statistic, p-value, and confidence interval for a two-tailed hypothesis test on the population mean.
It assumes the data are normally distributed and uses a t-test when the population standard deviation is unknown.
