\title{Proportion Test with Detailed Steps}
\usage{
prop_test(x, n, p = NULL, alternative = "two.sided", alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The number of successes in the sample (or a vector of successes for two samples).}

\item{n}{The sample size (or a vector of sample sizes for two samples).}

\item{p}{Null hypothesis proportion (for one sample) or NULL for two-sample test (default is NULL).}

\item{alternative}{The alternative hypothesis ("two.sided", "greater", or "less").}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list containing the test statistic, p-value, confidence interval, decision, and step-by-step explanation.
}
\description{
Performs a test for proportions and displays detailed work.

\examples{
# One-sample test
prop_test(x = 45, n = 100, p = 0.5, alternative = "two.sided", alpha = 0.05)
# Two-sample test
prop_test(x = c(30, 40), n = c(100, 120), alternative = "two.sided", alpha = 0.05)
