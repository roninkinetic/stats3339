\title{Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Test with Detailed Calculations}
\usage{
chi_squared_goodness_of_fit_single(observed, expected = NULL, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A numeric vector of observed frequencies.}

\item{expected}{A numeric vector of expected frequencies. If NULL, assumes equal frequencies.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for the hypothesis test (default: 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list containing the test statistic, p-value, rejection region, and a detailed explanation.
}
\description{
Performs a chi-squared goodness of fit test for categorical data and provides a detailed explanation of the calculations.
}
\examples{
# Example: Test if absences are equally distributed across days of the week
observed <- c(10, 12, 5, 10, 12, 11)
alpha <- 0.05
results <- chi_squared_goodness_of_fit_single(observed = observed, alpha = alpha)
print(results)
