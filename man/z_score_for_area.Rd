\title{Find Z-Score for a Given Area}
\usage{
z_score_for_area(area, tail = "left")
}
\arguments{
\item{area}{The cumulative area under the standard normal curve. For a left-tail test, this is the area to the left of the z-score.}

\item{tail}{Specify the tail of the test: "left", "right", or "two.sided".}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the z-score and an explanation.
}
\description{
Finds the z-score corresponding to a given cumulative area under the standard normal curve.
}
\examples{
z_score_for_area(area = 0.95, tail = "left") # 95\% cumulative area to the left
z_score_for_area(area = 0.05, tail = "right") # 5\% area to the right
z_score_for_area(area = 0.95, tail = "two.sided") # Two-sided 95\% confidence level
}
