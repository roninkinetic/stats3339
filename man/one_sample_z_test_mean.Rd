\usage{
one_sample_z_test_mean(
  sample_mean,
  sample_size,
  population_sd,
  hypothesized_mean,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_mean}{The mean of the sample (Xbar).}

\item{sample_size}{The size of the sample (n).}

\item{population_sd}{The population standard deviation (sigma).}

\item{hypothesized_mean}{The hypothesized population mean (mu)}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the test (default is 0.05).}

\item{alternative}{A character string specifying the alternative hypothesis.
Use "greater", "less", or "two.sided".}
}
\value{
A list containing the test statistic, p-value, decision, and a detailed explanation.
}
\description{
Performs a one-sample z-test to determine if a population mean differs from a hypothesized value.
