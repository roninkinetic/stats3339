\title{Perform Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test}
\usage{
chi_square_gof_test(observed, proportions, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A vector of observed frequencies.}

\item{proportions}{A vector of expected proportions (e.g., percentages as decimals).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list containing the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, and decision (Reject or Fail to Reject H0).
}
\description{
This function tests whether the observed frequencies differ significantly from the expected frequencies
based on given proportions.
