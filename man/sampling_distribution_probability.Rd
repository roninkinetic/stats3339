\title{Probability for Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean}
\usage{
sampling_distribution_probability(
  sample_mean,
  population_mean,
  population_sd,
  n,
  tail = "less"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_mean}{The hypothesized sample mean (e.g., total divided by sample size).}

\item{population_mean}{The population mean.}

\item{population_sd}{The population standard deviation.}

\item{n}{The sample size.}

\item{tail}{Specify "less", "greater", or "two-tailed" for the probability calculation.}
}
\value{
A list containing the calculated probability and a detailed explanation.
}
\description{
Calculates the probability for the sample mean based on the sampling distribution.
}
\examples{
# Example: Probability that the total grocery bill for one year is less than $7020
sampling_distribution_probability(
  sample_mean = 7020 / 52,
  population_mean = 140,
  population_sd = 10,
  n = 52,
  tail = "less"
)
